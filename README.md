## Overview

This CI/CD pipeline is designed to automatically run tests and deploy your web application's development branch to a server when changes are pushed. It utilizes GitHub Actions to streamline your development workflow.

## Workflow Description

1. On each push to the `development` branch, the CI/CD pipeline is triggered.
2. The pipeline:
   - Checks out the latest code from the repository.
   - Sets up a Node.js environment.
   - Installs project dependencies.
   - Runs tests to ensure code quality.
   - Deploys the application to the development server using SSH.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- A server where you can deploy your application (with SSH access)
- Node.js and npm installed on your local machine

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo

1. Configure Workflow:

    - Inside your repository, navigate to the "Actions" tab.
    - Click on "Set up a workflow yourself" and replace the generated YAML with the content from .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml in this repository.

2. Customize Deployment Steps:

   In the workflow YAML, replace the placeholder deployment steps with the actual commands necessary to deploy your application to the development server.

3. Push Changes:
   git add .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
git commit -m "Add CI/CD workflow"
git push origin development

Customization

- You can customize the workflow triggers, branches, and more by modifying the workflow YAML.
- For more advanced deployment scenarios, consider using containerization tools like Docker.

Security Considerations

- SSH Keys: Ensure that your server's SSH keys are properly configured and stored securely.
- Secrets: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in your workflow. Use GitHub Secrets to securely store sensitive data like SSH private keys and environment variables.

Troubleshooting

- Workflow Issues: If the workflow doesn't trigger, check the workflow status on the "Actions" tab for error details.
- Deployment Issues: If the deployment step fails, review the deployment script for errors and server configuration issues.
